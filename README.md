# Django Fine art Store

I have an keen interest in art and painting and wanted to build something simple and minimalist so I could have a place to store and view paintings without much extra going on around them. I wanted it to look like walking around a real gallery with paintings separated by white space to give a clean look

I also wanted also wanted a minimal look that was reminiscent of a painting on the wall with the name and year next to it

## UX

The UX was extremely important in this project. I wanted to make a positive user experience so the user would keep coming back to view paintings and see if there was any others that caught their eye

i wanted navigation to be the same in every part of the website so as not to confuse and potentially irritate users. I want to achieve a smooth experience for visitors who wont be put off by confusing navigation and to get to a painting in as few clicks as possible.

The painting leads to an add to cart option and clicking the painting again enlarges it.
There is also a featured artists section where visitors can learn more about the artists behind the paintings.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As someone who is interested in art and the paintings on the website I want the ability to go straight to the painting to get new ideas or expand my tastes. I also want the paintings to be clear and viewable without anything taking my attention. I was want  access to artworks that collectors canâ€™t get elsewhere **End user goal:**  the visitor sees a new painting for their collection  **End business goal:**  build out a complete and diverse library of paintings that caters for all tastes

As a new visitor to the website, The convenience of discovering and buying art online is vital to me. Collectors like me who have been buying art for longer periods and who have higher budgets prefers to buy art online  because of the speed and lowered friction of transacting online, particularly through online auctions.

As a visitor i want a clean and simple interface that clearly tells me where the paintings are.

Here is a folder with some mockups:



## Features

The features of my site are as follows:

-   Home: This is the landing page for my site. It shows an art inspired backdrop with logo and search bar that can return results based on the art style and year of painting
    
-   Paintings: Here you will find a collection of paintings, showing the artist name, year and name of the painting that enlarges when you click on it
    
-  Featured Artists : Here you can see a number of artists to go with some of their more popular paintings

### Features Left to Implement

-   A feature i would like to implement would be the use of discount codes
    
-   Expand the library to include other art forms such as sculpture, architecture, etc
    
- Manage refunds    

## Technologies Used

The technologies used in the creation of this website was HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also imported from Google Fonts and jQuery. I also used Python and Django

- Django - Used as the actual framework
    
-   [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)  - The project uses  **Google Font**  to add font styling
    
-   [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    

## Testing

I have conducted a lot of testing since the start of this project. Usually this would mean i would add extra features then save and then test how it looks and how it responds.

I would test after every piece of code. As per the user stories it shouldn't be too difficult to add more paintings or any other artform.

The way the site was made would be easy to more paintings and more features

I had some problems with understanding some of the python naming conventions and logic

i sent a link to friends and family and asked them to use the website and give feedback on what they thought needed to improve or any stumbling blocks they'd encountered.

Most of these problems were remedied by researching the issue and adding the relevant fixes such as entering the correct path to my css file or keeping track of my django labels

The devices i used to test the website was a PC, Macbook, iPhone and ipad.

## Deployment

The deployment was difficult this time. I kept getting issues with heroku.

## Credits

### Media

-   The background i found was a generic search in google and thought it was appropriate of other art  based websites
- the images and fixtures i found were from combinations of Kaggle datasets for the images and google searches for the artist photos.
- I also typed in each different painting name, year and price as well as bio for each artist
